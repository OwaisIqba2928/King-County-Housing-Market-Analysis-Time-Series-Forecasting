🏡 King County Housing Market Analysis & Time-Series Forecasting
📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the CareerFounder Advanced Analytics & Dashboard Designing course, focusing on real-world data analysis, visualization, and forecasting. We analyze King County's housing market trends and apply time-series forecasting to predict future house prices.

🔍 Key Focus Areas:
✔️ Housing market trends & price analysis
✔️ Data cleaning & preprocessing
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔️ Time-series forecasting using ARIMA
✔️ Interactive dashboards & visualizations

🎯 Project Objectives
1️⃣ Analyze Housing Market Trends
📌 Identify price fluctuations, seasonality & anomalies.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
📌 Handle missing values, format date columns & ensure consistency.

3️⃣ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Visualize price trends & relationships between house features.

4️⃣ Time-Series Forecasting
📌 Apply ARIMA & Moving Averages to predict future prices.

5️⃣ Build Interactive Dashboards
📌 Use Matplotlib, Seaborn & Tableau for static & dynamic visualizations.

📂 Dataset Information
Dataset: King County House Sales (May 2014 – May 2015)

🔑 Key Features:

🏠 price – Sale price of the house
🛏 bedrooms – Number of bedrooms
🛁 bathrooms – Number of bathrooms
📏 sqft_living – Square footage of living space
🌊 waterfront – Waterfront view availability
📅 date – Sale date
🏗 yr_built – Year house was built
📍 zipcode – Geographic location of the property
🛠 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
✅ Converted date column to datetime format for time-series analysis.
✅ Handled missing values & ensured data consistency.
✅ Dropped duplicate & irrelevant columns.
✅ Checked for outliers & transformed data where necessary.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🔹 1️⃣ Housing Price Trends Over Time
✔️ Used line charts to analyze price trends.
✔️ Identified an upward trajectory in property prices.

🔹 2️⃣ Relationship Between House Features & Prices
✔️ sqft_living had the strongest correlation with price.
✔️ Number of bedrooms showed weaker influence.

🔹 3️⃣ Price Distribution & Market Insights
✔️ Used histograms & boxplots to examine price distribution.
✔️ Identified outliers & luxury property price spikes.

📈 Time-Series Forecasting
🔹 1️⃣ Stationarity Check
✔️ ADF Test confirmed non-stationarity → Applied transformations.

🔹 2️⃣ Moving Averages
✔️ Used SMA & EMA for trend smoothing.

🔹 3️⃣ ARIMA Model for Forecasting
✔️ Applied Auto ARIMA to fine-tune (p, d, q) values.
✔️ Predicted price growth trends, confirming market appreciation.

📌 Key Findings:
✅ The model successfully captured seasonal trends.
✅ Forecasted prices indicate continued market growth.

📊 Dashboards & Visualizations
✅ Matplotlib & Seaborn Visualizations
📌 Line charts, heatmaps, histograms & boxplots.

✅ Interactive Tableau Dashboard
📌 Filters, geographical analysis & trend insights.

🔥 Key Insights & Business Impact
📌 Market Trends: Prices in King County are steadily increasing.
📌 Feature Impact: Larger sqft_living strongly affects price, bedrooms do not.
📌 Location Matters: Some zip codes show premium pricing.
📌 Forecasting: The ARIMA model predicts continued growth in housing prices.
📌 Luxury Homes & Waterfront Properties: Significantly boost prices.
